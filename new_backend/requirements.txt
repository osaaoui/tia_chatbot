# FastAPI and Server
fastapi>=0.100.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.23.0
python-multipart>=0.0.6 # For form data (file uploads)

# Langchain - Core, OpenAI integration
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.1.0 # Includes OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
# langchain-community might be needed for other loaders/components if added later

# Vector Store
chromadb>=0.4.22 # ChromaDB client

# Document Loaders & Processing
pypdf>=3.15.0 # For PDF loading (PyPDFLoader)

# Table Extraction - these have system dependencies
# User needs to ensure system libraries are installed:
# - For pdf2image: Poppler (e.g., `conda install -c conda-forge poppler` or `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`)
# - For pytesseract: Tesseract OCR engine (e.g., `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr` and language packs)
# - For camelot-py: Ghostscript, tk (e.g., `sudo apt-get install ghostscript python3-tk`)
camelot-py[cv]>=0.11.0 # [cv] installs OpenCV dependencies needed by Camelot
pytesseract>=0.3.10
pdf2image>=1.16.0
pandas>=1.3.0 # Often a dependency for table processing, good to have explicitly

# Environment Variable Management
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Password Hashing
passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4

# OpenAI client (Langchain OpenAI might include it, but good to specify)
openai>=1.3.0

# Tokenizer (if any part of the code still uses HuggingFace tokenizers directly)
# The provided Streamlit code had: from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# If estimate_token_count or similar is refactored in, this would be needed.
# For now, assuming OpenAI tokenization is handled internally by langchain-openai.
# transformers>=4.30.0

# Logging (FastAPI uses standard logging, but if more advanced needed)
# loguru>=0.7.0

# Note: Specific versions of PyTorch are not listed here as OpenAI embeddings
# do not require local PyTorch. If any other embedding or LLM model requiring
# PyTorch (e.g., from HuggingFace) were to be used, it would need to be added.

# Ensure that your Python version is compatible with these packages, typically Python 3.8+
# Remember to install system dependencies for camelot-py, pytesseract, and pdf2image.
